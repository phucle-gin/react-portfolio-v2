              Hey! I&apos;m Henry, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer from Melbourne, Australia. I
              specialize in both frontend and backend, primarily LAMP (Linux,
              Apache, MySql, PHP) stack alongside with Drupal and WordPress, but
              love building with whatever tools are right for the job.

              I currently work at Brightgreen, where I contribute to an in-house
              project to leverage their product design and aim to build robust,
              flexible, scalable solutions.
            </p>

              Outside of work, I love participating in outdoor activities,
              especially soccer. Any given Sunday, you&apos;ll find me showing
              off my footwork and having fun with my friends. ‚öΩÔ∏è

              I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my
              passion for building scalable websites. If you think you&apos;ve
              got an opening that I might interest, I would love to discuss
              about it. ‚úåüèª
