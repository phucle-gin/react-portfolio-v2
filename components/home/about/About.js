              Hey! I&apos;m Henry, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer from Melbourne,
              Australia. I specialize in both frontend and backend, primarily LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP) stack alongside with Drupal and WordPress, but
              love building with whatever tools are right for the job.

            I currently work at Arcadian Digital, where I contribute to projects for Federal Group Hospitality & Tourism, including Country Club, Wrest Point, and the Vantage Pub multisite network. I&apos;ve also worked with White Group on projects like Jack Meet and Whites Rural, as well as well-known local brands like Luna Park, Smile Solutions, Brunetti, and the Bupa Wellness Portal.

              Outside of work, I love participating in outdoor activities, especially soccer. Any given Sunday, you&apos;ll find me showing off my footwork and having fun with my friends. ‚öΩÔ∏è

              I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my passion for building scalable websites. If you think you&apos;ve got an opening that I might interest, I would love to discuss about it. ‚úåüèª
